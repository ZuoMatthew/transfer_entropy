# Transfer Entropy

Implementation in python of transfer entropy statistic between two time series.  

Transfer entropy from X to Y, where X,Y are two random processes, is the reduction in uncertainty for a future value of X given the history of X and Y.  It is calculated as the mutual information with conditional probabilities: A version of the Kullback-Leibler relative probability.
